Introduction
The Music Recommendation System using SQL is a project aimed at creating a personalized music recommendation engine. Using SQL, this system analyzes user interactions with a music platform to recommend songs, artists, or genres that align with the user’s preferences. This project showcases the power of SQL in handling large-scale data and extracting actionable insights for personalized content delivery.
Objectives
•	To design and implement a relational database that stores user interaction data, song details, and artist information.
•	To write efficient SQL queries to generate personalized music recommendations based on user history and preferences.
•	To analyse music consumption patterns and provide insights into user behaviour.


Database Design
Entities
Users: Stores user profiles and preferences.
Songs: Contains details about songs, including title, artist, album, and genre.
Artists: Information about music artists.
Albums: Details of music albums.
User-playlist: Details of playlists if users.
Recommendations: It provides recommended details 
•	One-to-Many: A user can have multiple interactions with different songs.
•	Many-to-One: A song can belong to only one artist.
•	Many-to-Many: Users can like multiple songs, and songs can be liked by multiple users.
SQL Queries and Analysis
User Profiling
This query analyzes user interaction data to profile users based on their most listened-to genres, preferred artists, and other behavior.
Song Recommendations
A complex SQL query that suggests new songs to users by finding similarities between their listening habits and popular trends in the database.
Data Insights
•	Most active users based on the number of interactions.
•	Trending artists and genres over a given period.
Results
The system successfully provided personalized recommendations and insights. For example, users with a preference for pop music were recommended the latest trending pop songs and artists.
Challenges Faced
•	Managing large datasets efficiently with SQL.
•	Optimizing query performance to ensure quick recommendations.
•	Handling ambiguous or sparse data in the user interactions.
Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effective use of SQL for building a recommendation system, highlighting SQL's power in data analysis and its ability to manage relational data efficiently.
Future Work
•	Integrating real-time data processing for live recommendations.
•	Extending the database to include more user demographics and interaction types.
